# Hybrid Systems for Practical AI
Adrian Hopgood

## Overview of AI techniques
### Semantic Intelligence
knowledge based, explicit written rules

rules
case based reasoning
model-based reasoning
frames

### Computational Intelligence
neural networks & deep learning
genetic algorithms
artificial immune systems

## Why hybrids?
### Multifaceted problems

multiple subtasks that needs to be tackled

need specialised agents to tackle specialised subtasks

#### Exemple
- Plasma deposition:
    - things you can measure different from things you can control
    - 14 parameters, hard to control for human, relativly easy for a set of
      specialised genetic algorithms
- Optimize network flow

### Clarification and verification
- Postcode recognition

### Capability enhancement
- Cascading neural networks for oral cancer detection
- Hybrid genetic algorithms

### Parameter setting
Use fuzzy logic to set parameters for another technique

auto-tunning parameters

### Divide & conquer
- Image registration

divide a problem into different little problems

## Conclusion
1956 -> first use of the expression AI

We are far from a general intelligence algorithm
- We have good specialized algorithm and good automation

### The future
Bridging the intelligence spectrum through hybrids

Embedded AI
